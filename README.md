## Overview
Pentest Toolkit PS is a Python-based tool designed for ethical hacking and penetration testing. It provides functionalities for:

- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports on a target system and perform basic banner grabbing.
- **SSH Brute Forcing**: Attempt to log in to SSH servers using username and password combinations.

This tool is developed with ease of use in mind and incorporates threading for efficient operations.

## Features
1. **Port Scanning**
   - Identifies open ports within a given range on a target IP or Hostname.
   - Performs basic banner grabbing for open ports.

2. **SSH Brute Force**
   - Attempts to log in to an SSH server using a list of usernames and passwords.
   - Supports loading credentials from files or manual input.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hipremsoni/CODTECH_ADVANCED_TASK_3.git
cd CODTECH_ADVANCED_TASK_3
```

### 2. Install Requirements Packages 
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

### 3. Run the Script
```bash
python toolkitps.py
```
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `socket`
  - `logging`
  - `concurrent.futures`
  - `paramiko`
  - `pyfiglet`
  - `colorama`

### 3. Operations

#### Port Scanning
1. Select option `1` for Port Scanning.
2. Enter the target IP address.
3. Specify the range of ports (start and end).
4. Provide a timeout value in seconds.
5. View results with open ports and banners (if available).

#### SSH Brute Force
1. Select option `2` for SSH Brute Force.
2. Enter the target IP address.
3. Choose to provide credentials via a file or manually.
4. If using a file, enter the file paths for usernames and passwords.
